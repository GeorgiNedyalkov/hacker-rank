# HackerRank Problems for week 2 of 3 moths preparation plan

1. Grading Students

Every student receives a grad for 0 to 100
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade

The grades are rounded according to these rules:

- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
- If the value of the grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs because it is a failing grade.

Examples:

- grade = 84 rount to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
- grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
- grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Given the initial grade for each of Sam's students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Reutn the grades after rounding.
